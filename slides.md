# Excited Developer Syndrome

***noun*** 

## _Definition:_ ...

<!--
And instead of giving you a boring definition
-->

---
layout: image
image: /story.svg
---

<!--
We'll start with an example

a story
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev.svg
---

<!--
of a developer named alex

are there any alex's here?

oh no...

Okay uh we'll start with the story

of a developer named ash

(If your name is Ash, I'm sorry, but the story must go on.)
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_amazing.svg
---

<!--
Ash was an amazing programmer.

Not only because they knew all their fundamentals.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_learn.svg
---

<!--
But they were a quick learner, and loved learning new things! 
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_bored.svg
---

<!--
And whenever they were bored with the status quo
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_cool.svg
---

<!--
they'd look up the latest trends and cool technologies.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_strong.svg
---

<!--
The week Ash joined their new team, they were quickly able to finish their first ticket.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_think.svg
---

<!--
But Ash wasn't just a good learner.

They also had sparks of curiosity.

By the end of their first month, they had questioned, and were able to identify multiple problems the company was facing.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_angry.svg
---

<!--
But Ash wasn't a complainer

They knew that solutions spoke louder than problems.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_fast.svg
---

<!--
And Ash was *good* at building out solutions

and doing so quickly.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /hand.svg
---

<!--
Now can I get a show of hands for who can relate to Ash?

Okay about X of you.

What about someone who knows of someone like Ash?

Okay about Y of you.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_party.svg
---

<!--
Ash was doing quite well. In fact, so well that it didn't make sense for them to stay where they were.

Throughout their career,

Ash would get promoted, for integrating that cool new technology,
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_team.svg
---

<!--
when they got curious for what else they could build, they'd change teams,
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_company.svg
---

<!--
and when they got bored, they'd change companies to work on the next big thing.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_leader.svg
---

<!--
And to guide others down their path,

they became a leader,

and a manager. 

All, which was great news for Ash!
-->

---

<!--
But the world doesn't revolve around Ash.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /blake.svg
---

<!--
This is Blake

> TODO: say hi blake
-->

---
layout: image
image: /blake.svg
---

<!--
Blake is a member of Ash's old team, where Ash integrated that cool new technology.

Blake was always sceptical that this cool new technology that Ash wanted to integrate was a good idea, but she couldn't quite put her finger on why.

-->

---
layout: image
image: /blake_sad.svg
---

<!--
Months after Ash left, Blake now had to remove the integration.
Not only was it not solving the core problem, but it was causing security issues, since it was no longer new, cool, and supported.

-->

---
layout: image
image: /chris.svg
---

<!--
This is Chris

Chris couldn't understand why Ash wanted to spend time building out a solution in house, when one already existed.

But he didn't really care because it wasn't his problem.

-->

---
layout: image
image: /chris_sad.svg
---

<!--
That is until Ash left, and now all the bugs were being reported to him. 

He barely had the time to replace it with a pre-existing library, let alone fix all the bugs.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /daisy.svg
---

<!--
And this is Daisy

Her Job was to build out features for the product.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /daisy_sad.svg
---

<!--
She wasn't happy with Ash's lack of tests for the over engineered solutions in the sake of building quickly.

Now, she's burdened daily by the technical debt.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_no_see.svg
---

<!--
And Ash?

Well now that Ash has moved on, they'll never see or be impacted by the detriments of their decisions.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_excited.svg
---

<!--
Because in their excitement to build out solutions to all the problems that they thought they saw,
-->

---
layout: image
image: /stop.svg
---

<!--
They never really stopped to fully understand the problem at hand,

to deeply investigate why things were the way they were,

ask whether the problem needed solving

and maybe realise that the best solution didn't require new code at all.

And this is not uncommon.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /hand.svg
---

<!--
Can I get a show of hands, if you can still relate to Ash, or met someone like them?

That's still quite a lot of you...

<!--
Now for the law of *truly* large numbers,

The lottery is a good way of explaining.

And so I don't lose you trying to explain maths.

Could someone shout out what the odds are for winning the jackpot lottery.

1 in a million

But many people have won the lottery, so we want a rarer event.

What about someone winning the lottery twice, that'd be like, 1 in a trillion?

That's astronomically impossible! 

But yet there are multiple people who've won the lottery twice, because there's 8 billion people and multiple lotteries happening every day.

Similarly many things, like software projects on aren't or can't be indexed.

Don't just rely on Google.

Try other search engines.

# Type II Errors / False Negatives

<!--
In either case, be wary of false negatives or Type 2 errors. 
-->

---
layout: image
image: /covid.svg
---

<!--
A Type 2 error is like when an RAT test gives you a negative result. When actually you do have COVID. 

Similarly, the search might come up with nothing, but that might be because the search is wrong.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /iceberg.svg
---

<!--
None of these tools can be sources of truth.

Because regardless of how good they are,

they can't find what hasn't been made public.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /hand.svg
---

<!--
For example, a show of hands from anyone whose made a tool at work that you couldn't share, or a personal tool that you didn't get around to sharing, or for which you weren't comfortable making public? 

That's about X of you, and if you consider that this is a conference about Open Source, the reality is probably less!
-->

---
layout: image
image: /talking.svg
---

<!--
And I bet that if we all talked to each other, there'd be at least one of you who was looking for a solution, and another who had already built it.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev.svg
---

<!--
I'd also gamble that on multiple occasions, someone like Ash _did_ find a solution but decided not to use it.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /but_why.gif
---

<!--
But Why?

Why wouldn't you use a solution that already exists?
-->

---
layout: statement

# Not Invented Here

<!--
Ash was likely a victim of Not Invented Here, a bias against ideas from the outside.

[12:57]
-->

---
layout: image
image: /nih_study.svg
---

<!--
And empirically you don't want this bias, because a study shows that it causes performance to decline.

But I've seen too many companies decide to re-build solutions in house, for solutions that exist as paid, managed products.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /feature_flag.svg
---

<!--
From simple feature flagging software, that change what users see.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /chatgpt_logo.svg
---

<!--
To complex products like Chat-GPT.
-->

---

<!--
So perhaps these companies don't agree, or their team's performance is not an issue.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /nih_security.svg
---

<!--
Maybe they really care about keeping their data in house for security.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /nih_dependency.svg
---

<!--
Or they don't want to have yet another dependency that could fail and be out of their control.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /nih_custom.svg
---

<!--
Or maybe they want customizability that the off the shelf product can't offer.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /nih_promotion.svg
---

<!--
Or worst of all, Ash wanted something complex to build for a promotion.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /nih_all.svg
---

<!--
I'm not going to argue that these aren't valid reasons. They definitely have their place.
-->

---

---

<!--
> TODO: Looking eyes fading in.

(Okay maybe I'll argue against the last one)
-->

---
layout: image
image: /nih_all.svg
---

<!--
But they are all tradeoffs, and we have to consider.

Are these benefits worth the cost? 
-->

---
layout: image
image: /nih_security_only.svg
---

<!--
Is keeping data in house that important, when everyone is communicating through tools like Slack, or using external unknown tools like their personal LLM?
-->

---
layout: image
image: /nih_dependency_only.svg
---

<!--
Are dependencies that concerning, if the internal infrastructure would be less stable?
-->

---
layout: image
image: /nih_custom_only.svg
---

<!--
Is that one extra feature worth the additional complexity?
-->

---
layout: image
image: /nih_promotion.svg
---

<!--
Or is building out an entire new promotion worthy product worth the maintenance burden?
-->

---
layout: image
image: /nih_all.svg
---

<!--
And if the answer to some of these questions is yes, then that's perfectly fine!
-->

---
layout: image
image: /thinking.svg
---

<!--
What's more important is that they've been thought of.

Because building takes time, and time is money.
-->

---
layout: fact
---

# ~ $1,000,000 / year
cost for in house team

<!--
One million dollars would be the yearly cost for an in house team dedicated to build, maintain, debug, and secure, a product like feature flags.
-->

---
layout: fact
---

# ~ $120,000 / year
paid product for 1 million users

<!--
Or, for around an eighth for that, you can buy an off the shelf product that supports one million users. 

Which don't forget, is run by a team whose sole job is managing the reliability and security of this product.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /construction.webp
---

<!--
I can't really blame Ash for being a victim to Not Invented Here.

This bias exists because the nature of our industry encourages it.

I mean, can you imagine working in an industry like construction, where timelines are on the order of years? 

In comparison, software engineering is blessed with the ability to iterate quickly, through building, testing, and validating ideas, and personally I can't give that up.

# Source https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btGWg-IPwlY

---
layout: image
image: /generative_ai.svg
---

<!--
And with the advent of generative AI, that produces code better by the day, we can't expect this bias to go away.

It's now easier than ever for someone to come up with an idea, and get to a working solution faster than they could find and integrate and existing one, because they've decided they can do a better job re-building it with the help of AI.

And I can't really stop that.

---
layout: image
image: /thought_bubble.svg
---

<!--
But I have experienced where that can go wrong.

So if we do go down the route of re-building

These tools that help us build quicker make it easy to do so with less thinking.

So we must remind ourselves that whatever is built is likely half complete, and can't just be called done.

What if Ash had considered contributing back to fix the framework?

Submitting a PR will likely not only take less time than starting from scratch, but also make the solution more useful for everyone else!
-->

---
layout: image
image: /star_history.svg
---

<!--
Which in turn, makes the solution more popular,

and thus, becomes a compounding investment in the project's success and sustainability.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /pr_closed.svg
---

<!--
But maybe Ash did try making a PR.

And it didn't make sense because the change was too different for the project.

Or maybe the author didn't want to accept it.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /fork.svg
---

<!--
What if before starting from scratch, Ash considered making their changes on a fork?

Which wouldn't only save their time, but also anyone else who followed their path.

Even if they don't want the work to be public, they'll still save themselves time, especially if the upstream project makes changes that you could merge and benefit from.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_angry.svg
---

<!--
But if Ash is adamant that they must start from scratch, that's fine too.

And it's okay not to like something or not have the time.

Like, it's not always the case that fixing a bug will be easier than starting from scratch.

# Creating another standard?

- Think
- Contribute
- Fork
- Communicate

<!--
At the end of the day, there's nothing that can force Ash to make these choices. They have to come from within.

So if it does pain you to see another standard being created, I do encourage you to at least leave some feedback, or a trail, for others who search to find your path.

The Budworm was an important element of the ecosystem. 

Without the Budworm, these forests would become a monoculture of Fir, which was the Budworm's favourite food.

layout: image
image: /budworm_happy.svg

<!--
So these pesticides which were meant to control the budworm population, did so, but only temporarily, before they exploded uncontrollably.

Because in addition to giving the budworms more food, the pesticides were also killing the budworm's predators.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /budworm_love.svg

<!--
Soon after, they realised that in some forests, they could replace spraying with proper forest management, and co-exist with the budworms.

But in other forests?

It was a lost cause.

The only way forward was to continue the negative spiral of spraying more.

<!--
A real scenario that a developer came across (and almost became an Ash) was when they were working on a country wide High Frequency network.

layout: image
image: /hf_communicate.svg
---

<!--
The network was built to communicate between a source and destination.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /hf_interference.svg
---

<!--
And it had to ensure that it was doing so with the best signal.

Because when you're sending over a High Frequency, there can be a lot of noise and interference.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /hf_thinking.svg
---

<!--
So the network had been built so that on every transmission, it would predict what configuration would produce the best signal.

It would predict this configuration by running calculations on things like the state of the ionosphere, and the

type, location, and orientation of the source and destination antennas.
-->

And after making this prediction and transmission, it could compare the signal quality against the prediction.

Now this network was fully functional and battle tested.

It should be cached, so they don't have to run these expensive and possibly inaccurate calculations.

Now, saving a state for use is not exactly a difficult implementation.

Removing that test, that process, that would now no longer provide value, is infinity more valuable than perpetually spending time fixing it.

But that's not possible if you don't truly understand the system.

One way to think about the system is to bias for inaction.

Don't just build what you're told.

Question the why, to help you understand the underlying problem.
