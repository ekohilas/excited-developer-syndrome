# Excited Developer Syndrome

<!--
So today I want to talk about a phenomenon I'm coining "Excited Developer Syndrome"
-->
---

# Def: ...

<!--
And instead of giving you a boring definition
-->

---
layout: image
image: /story.svg
---

<!--
We'll start with an example

a story
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev.svg
---

<!--
of a developer named alex

are there any alex's here?

oh no...

Okay uh we'll start with the story

of a developer named ash

(If your name is Ash, I'm sorry, but the story must go on.)
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_amazing.svg
---

<!--
Ash was an amazing programmer.

Not only because they knew all their fundamentals.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_learn.svg
---

<!--
But they were a quick learner, and loved learning new things! 
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_bored.svg
---

<!--
And whenever they were bored with the status quo
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_cool.svg
---

<!--
they'd look up the latest trends and cool technologies.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_strong.svg
---

<!--
The week Ash joined their new team, they were quickly able to finish their first ticket.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_think.svg
---

<!--
But Ash wasn't just a good learner.

They also had sparks of curiosity.

By the end of their first month, they had questioned, and were able to identify multiple problems the company was facing.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_angry.svg
---

<!--
But Ash wasn't a complainer

They knew that solutions spoke louder than problems.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_fast.svg
---

<!--
And Ash was *good* at building out solutions

and doing so quickly.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /hand.svg
---

<!--
Now can I get a show of hands for who can relate to Ash?

Okay about X of you.

What about someone who knows of someone like Ash?

Okay about Y of you.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_party.svg
---

<!--
Ash was doing quite well. In fact, so well that it didn't make sense for them to stay where they were.

Throughout their career,

Ash would get promoted, for integrating that cool new technology,
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_team.svg
---

<!--
when they got curious for what else they could build, they'd change teams,
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_company.svg
---

<!--
and when they got bored, they'd change companies to work on the next big thing.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_leader.svg
---

<!--
And to guide others down their path,

they became a leader,

and a manager. 

All, which was great news for Ash!
-->

---

<!--
But the world doesn't revolve around Ash.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /blake.svg
---

<!--
This is Blake

# TODO: say hi blake
-->

---
layout: image
image: /blake.svg
---

<!--
Blake is a member of Ash's old team, where Ash integrated that cool new technology.

Blake was always sceptical that this cool new technology that Ash wanted to integrate was a good idea, but she couldn't quite put her finger on why.

-->

---
layout: image
image: /blake_sad.svg
---

<!--
Months after Ash left, Blake now had to remove the integration.
Not only was it not solving the core problem, but it was causing security issues, since it was no longer new, cool, and supported.

-->

---
layout: image
image: /chris.svg
---

<!--
This is Chris

Chris couldn't understand why Ash wanted to spend time building out a solution in house, when one already existed.

But he didn't really care because it wasn't his problem.

-->

---
layout: image
image: /chris_sad.svg
---

<!--
That is until Ash left, and now all the bugs were being reported to him. 

He barely had the time to replace it with a pre-existing library, let alone fix all the bugs.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /daisy.svg
---

<!--
And this is Daisy

Her Job was to build out features for the product.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /daisy_sad.svg
---

<!--
She wasn't happy with Ash's lack of tests for the over engineered solutions in the sake of building quickly.

Now, she's burdened daily by the technical debt.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_no_see.svg
---

<!--
And Ash?

Well now that Ash has moved on, they'll never see or be impacted by the detriments of their decisions.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_excited.svg
---

<!--
Because in their excitement to build out solutions to all the problems that they thought they saw,
-->

---
layout: image
image: /stop.svg
---

<!--
They never really stopped to fully understand the problem at hand,

to deeply investigate why things were the way they were,

ask whether the problem needed solving

and maybe realise that the best solution didn't require new code at all.

And this is not uncommon.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /hand.svg

<!--
Can I get a show of hands, if you can still relate to Ash, or met someone like them?

That's still quite a lot of you...

# Excited Developer Syndrome

<!--
This is the "Excited Developer Syndrome"

# Excited Developer Syndrome 
## Def: A developer, who is excited for building out quick solutions, before fully understanding the problem at hand, and thus often become unmaintainable out of not retaining responsibility.

A developer, who is excited for building out quick solutions, before fully understanding the problem at hand, and thus often become unmaintainable out of not retaining responsibility. 
-->

---
layout: image
image: /thinking.svg
---

<!--
Now you all might be thinking,

if you can relate to the "Excited Developer Syndrome",

that is so prevalent within our industry,

especially in one which generative AI makes building easier by the day,

what can one do to prevent it, to stop it from affecting us?

# TODO: Give sources? Why people should listen?
# TODO: Add clarity when it's the right mindset to have
-->

---
duration: 9.5min
---

# 🤔

<!--
The first thing would be to think about existing solutions.
-->

---

# Your proposal is not unique.

<!--
Your proposal (to an existing problem) is not unique.
-->

---

# 🧠

<!--
But how can I make this claim when there's over 8 billion minds on this earth?
-->

---

# 1.
# 2.

<!--
Well, it's because of two phenomenon.
-->

---

# 1. Law of truly large numbers
# 2. 

<!--
The first is the Law of truly large numbers
-->

---

# 1. Law of <span v-mark="{ type: 'crossed-off', color: 'red', seed: 1 }">truly</span> large numbers
# 2. 

<!--
Not to be confused with the law of large numbers
-->

---

<img fixed inset-0 src="/jelly_bean_jar.svg" />

# 1. Law of <span v-mark="{ type: 'crossed-off', color: 'red', seed: 1 }">truly</span> large numbers
# 2. 

<!--
which simply put, says that if I take the average of all of your guesses for how many jelly beans are in this jar, it'd converge to be correct. 

# TODO: For the record, the answer is...
-->

---

<img fixed inset-0 src="/lottery.svg" />

# 1. Law of *truly* large numbers
# 2. 

<!--
Now for the law of *truly* large numbers,

The lottery is a good way of explaining.

And so I don't lose you trying to explain maths.

Could someone shout out what the odds are for winning the jackpot lottery.

1 in a million

But many people have won the lottery, so we want a rarer event.

What about someone winning the lottery twice, that's like astronomically impossible, like 1 in a billion?

But yet there are multiple people who've won the lottery twice, because there's 8 billion people and multiple lotteries happening every day.
-->

---

# 1. Law of truly large numbers
# 2. Simultaneous Invention

<!--
The second phenomenon is simultaneous invention.

And forgive me in advance for the pronunciation of these names.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /emc2.svg
# should keep for notability
---

<!--
Raise your hand if you knew that Henri Poincare also invented E=mc2, and that Einstein only provided the accepted interpretation.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /thorium.svg
---

<!--
What about the fact that both Marie Curie and Gerhard Carl Schmidt both discovered Thorium radioactivity?
-->


---
layout: image
image: /machine.svg
# should keep for relevance
---

<!--
Or if you knew that the Turing Machine was also proposed in the same year independently by Emil Post
-->

---
layout: image
image: /rsa.svg
# should keep due to relevance to being hidden
---

<!--
My favourite one, did anyone know that RSA was described 4 years earlier by Clifford Cocks, who couldn't say anything because he was working for UK's intelligence agency?
-->

---

# 1. Law of truly large numbers
# 2. Simultaneous Invention

<!--
So we have this combination of phenomenon,
-->

---

# 1. Law of truly large numbers
# [2. Simultaneous Invention]{style="opacity:50%"}

<!--
where one says that a solution already exists,
-->

---

# [1. Law of truly large numbers]{style="opacity:50%"}
# 2. Simultaneous Invention

<!--
and the other, that it's hidden or hard to find.

I'm sure you've come across this in your life.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /thorium.svg
---

<!--
Remember that silhouette of Gerhard earlier?
-->

---
layout: image
image: /empty_google_search.png
---

<!--
That's because there's no images of him on Google.

All these pictures are of someone else!

But if you do find him let me know.

At the least, I'm sure there's a photo of the guy in someone's family picture book, waiting to be indexed by Googled.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /ci_test_google_search.png
---

<!--
Similarly many things, like software projects on aren't or can't be indexed.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /google_search_seo_bloat.svg
---

<!--
Or, they're a needle in the haystack of hundreds of company pages exploiting the search engine optimization algorithm (or SEO).
-->

---
layout: image
image: /duck_duck_go_logo.svg
---

<!--
So my advice here is to get creative.

Don't just rely on Google.

Try other search engines.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /gitlab_logo.svg
---

<!--
Search GitHub, and other code repositories (but note that GitLab requires you to log in...)
-->

---
layout: image
image: /github_search.svg
---

<!--
For example, I've found tools for GitLab to only exist on GitHub.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /llm_search.svg
---

<!--
Or if there's still not results, try using an LLM's deep research,

which is helpful in bypassing SEO bloat,

and understanding the underlying intent of your words.
-->

---

# Type II Errors / False Negatives

<!--
In either case, be wary of false negatives or Type 2 errors. 
-->

---
layout: image
image: /covid.svg
---

<!--
A Type 2 error is like when an RAT test gives you a negative result. When actually you do have COVID. 

Similarly, the search might come up with nothing, but that might be because the search is wrong.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /iceberg.svg
---

<!--
None of these tools can be sources of truth.

Because regardless of how good they are,

they can't find what hasn't been made public.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /hand.svg
---

<!--
For example, a show of hands from anyone whose made a tool at work that you couldn't share, or a personal tool that you didn't get around to sharing, or for which you weren't comfortable making public? 

That's about X of you, and if you consider that this is a conference about Open Source, the reality is probably less!
-->

---
layout: image
image: /talking.svg
---

<!--
And I bet that if we all talked to each other, there'd be at least one of you who was looking for a solution, and another who had already built it.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev.svg
---

<!--
I'd also gamble that on multiple occasions, someone like Ash _did_ find a solution but decided not to use it.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /but_why.gif
---

<!--
But Why?

Why wouldn't you use a solution that already exists?
-->

---

# Not Invented Here

<!--
Ash was likely a victim of Not Invented Here, a bias against ideas from the outside.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /nih_study.svg
---

<!--
And empirically you don't want this bias, because a study shows that it causes performance to decline.
-->

---

# 🏗️ 

<!--
But I've seen too many companies decide to re-build solutions in house, for solutions that exist as paid, managed products.
-->

---

# 🚩

<!--
From simple feature flagging software,
-->

---

# 🤖

<!--
To Chat-GPT.
-->

---

# 🤷

<!--
So perhaps these companies don't agree, or their team's performance is not an issue.
-->

---

# 🔒

<!--
Maybe they really care about keeping their data in house for security.
-->

---

# 🔗

<!--
Or they don't want to have yet another dependency that could fail and be out of their control.
-->

---

# 🎨

<!--
Or maybe they want customizability that the off the shelf product can't offer.
-->

---

# 🎖️

<!--
Or worst of all, Ash wanted something complex to build for a promotion.
-->

---

# 👀

<!--
I'm not going to argue that these aren't valid reasons. They definitely have their place.

# TODO: Looking eyes fading in.

(Okay maybe I'll argue against the last one)
-->

---

# ⚖️

<!--
But they are all tradeoffs, and we have to consider.
-->

---

# 💰

<!--
Are these benefits worth the cost? 
-->

---

# 🔒💬

<!--
Is keeping data in house that important, when everyone is communicating through tools like Slack, or using external unknown tools like their personal LLM?
-->

---

# 🔗🏗️

<!--
Are dependencies that concerning, if the internal infrastructure would be less stable?
-->

---

# ➕

<!--
Is that one extra feature worth the additional complexity?
-->

---

# 🏆

<!--
Or is building out an entire new promotion worthy product worth the maintenance burden?
-->

---

# ✅

<!--
And if the answer to some of these questions is yes, then that's perfectly fine!
-->

---

# 🤔

<!--
What's more important is that they've been thought of.
-->

---

# ⏰💰

<!--
Because building takes time, and time is money.
-->

---

# 💵

<!--
A team being dedicated to build, maintain, debug, and secure, a product like feature flags, can cost on the order of a million dollars a year.
-->

---

# 💸

<!--
Or, if you had 1 million users, it would cost around 1/8th of that to pay for a product.
-->

---

# 🛡️

<!--
Which don't forget, is run by a team whose sole job is managing the reliability and security of this product.
-->

---

# 🧑‍💻

<!--
I can't really blame Ash for being a victim to Not Invented Here This bias exists because the nature of our industry encourages it.
-->

---

# 🏗️⏳

<!--
I mean, can you imagine working in an industry like construction, where timelines are on the order of years? 
-->

---

# ⚡

<!--
In comparison, software engineering is blessed with the ability to iterate quickly, through building, testing, and validating ideas, and personally I can't give that up.
-->

---

# 🤖✨

<!--
And with the advent of generative AI, that produces code better by the day, we can't expect this bias to go away.
-->

---

# 🚀

<!--
It's now easier than ever for someone to come up with an idea, and get to a working solution faster than they could find and integrate and existing one, because they've decided they can do a better job re-building it with the help of AI.

# TODO: Shrug emoji.
-->

---

# 🤷

<!--
And I can't really stop that.
-->

---

# ⚠️

<!--
But I have experienced where that can go wrong.

# TODO: Add example
-->

---

# 🔨

<!--
So if we do go down the route of re-building
-->

---

# 🧠

<!--
These tools that help us build quicker make it easy to do so with less thinking.
-->

---

# ⚠️

<!--
So we must remind ourselves that whatever is built is likely half complete, and can't just be called done.

<!--
In one case, Ash was looking to build a website.

And they found this free and open source framework called

---

<!--
React.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_angry.svg
---

<!--
But this wasn't the great news that I was expecting from Ash.

Turns out, it didn't exactly do what they wanted it to do.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /framework_logos.svg
---

<!--
And neither did the other 8 frameworks
-->

---
layout: image

---

<!--
So then there was 9...
-->

---
layout: image
image: /pr.svg
---

<!--
What if Ash had considered contributing back to fix the framework?

Submitting a PR will likely not only take less time than starting from scratch, but also make the solution more useful for everyone else!
-->

---
layout: image
image: /star_history.svg
---

<!--
Which in turn, makes the solution more popular,

and thus, becomes a compounding investment in the project's success and sustainability.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /pr_closed.svg
---

<!--
But maybe Ash did try making a PR.

And it didn't make sense because the change was too different for the project.

Or maybe the author didn't want to accept it.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /fork.svg
---

<!--
What is before starting from scratch, Ash considered making their changes on a fork?

Which wouldn't only save their time, but also anyone else who followed their path.

Even if they don't want the work to be public, they'll still save themselves time, especially if the upstream project makes changes that you could merge and benefit from.
-->

---
layout: image
image: /dev_angry.svg
---

<!--
But if Ash is adamant that they must start from scratch, that's fine too.

And it's okay not to like something or not have the time.
-->

---
layout: image

<!--
Like, it's not always the case that fixing a bug will be easier than starting from scratch.

# Creating another standard?

1. Think
2. Contribute
3. Fork
4. Communicate 

<!--
At the end of the day, there's nothing that can force Ash to make these choices. They have to come from within.

So if it does pain you to see another standard being created, I do encourage you to at least leave some feedback, or a trail, for others who search to find your path.

Then don't let me stop you!
-->

---

# 🏗️

<!--
Go forth and build!
-->

---

# 🧠

<!--
But I hope you'll do so with a new frame of mind, so that tomorrow, when Ash thinks about building the same thing, they'll quickly discover your work, and maybe, your work will be inspiring enough for them to contribute back and improve upon your work, rather than decide to start from scratch, and build something internally that will never see the light of day.

# ❓

<!--
But wait, should you actually build it?

# TODO: Title

# 🌐

<!--
Think about the system
-->

---

# 🤔

<!--
This is a question we often don't get to ask in our excitement.

# TODO: Can I incorporate a single example as the main thread?
-->

---

# 👀

<!--
If we pause for a moment, breathe, look around us, and remove the blinders of excitement, then we could ask, what is the underlying system that we see at play?
-->

---

# 📚

<!--
This is one of the core principles that Donella Meadows highlights in her book "Thinking in Systems"
-->

---

# 🌲

<!--
She gives the example of the late 1900's Canadian lumber industry which would harvest Spruce and Fir trees.
-->

---

# 🐛

<!--
However, they had a problem, the Budworm pest, which would kill these trees.
-->

---

# 💉

<!--
So over 30 years, they sprayed pesticides.
-->

---

# 📈💰

<!--
Each year became more and more expensive, and by 1980, they had spent an unmanageable 12.5 million in that year alone.
-->

---

# ❓

<!--
Why was this considered unmanageable?
-->

---

# 🌲💀

<!--
Well after 30 years of spraying, the Budworm was still killing as many as 20 million hectares of trees per year.
-->

---

# 🔬

<!--
It wasn't until two Ecology and Forestry researchers built a computer model to get a whole system look, that they discovered that the Budworm wasn't a pest.
-->

---

# 🔄

<!--
The Budworm was an important element of the ecosystem. 
-->

---

# 🌲

<!--
Without the Budworm, these forests would become a monoculture of Fir, which was the Budworm's favourite food.
-->

---

# 🦟

<!--
And these pesticides, would not only increase the Budworm's food supply, but also it's predators, which where there to keep it in check from exploding in an uncontrollable manner.
-->

---

# 💻

<!--
If we extrapolate this example into the world of software, it'd be like 
-->

---

# 📝

<!--
when we waste time in every review on nits.
-->

---

# 🤔

<!--
If we stop to analyse the system, we could realise that, they could be accepted as being inevitable. 
-->

---

# 

<!--
Maybe that's not an answer, because like Budworms, too many nits can affect the final product.
-->

---

# 🛠️

<!--
And instead it's worth taking a different approach, like changing the tree harvesting strategy, or like adding lint rules to stop nits from getting to a review in the first place.

# TODO: Are the other examples better?

wasting time in every review on nits, instead of adding lint rules to stop them from getting to the review in the first place.

continuously trying to fix a flakey test that keeps popping up, instead of thinking about whether the test is needed in the first place.

# Nothing >>> Something

<!--
# TODO: Title

Nothing, is infinitely better than something.
-->

---

# 📡

<!--
A real scenario that a developer came across (and almost became an Ash) was when they were working on a country wide High Frequency network.
-->

---

# 📡🔄

<!--
The network was built to communicate between a source and destination.
-->

---

# 📶

<!--
And it had to ensure that it was doing so with the best signal.
-->

---

# 📻

<!--
Because when you're sending over a High Frequency, there can be a lot of noise and interference.
-->

---

# 🔮

<!--
So the network had been built so that on every transmission, it would predict what configuration would produce the best signal.
-->

---

# 🌍

<!--
It would predict this configuration by running calculations on things like the state of the ionosphere,
-->

---

# 📡

<!--
the type, location, and orientation of the source and destination antennas.
-->

---

# 📊

<!--
And after making this prediction and transmission, it could compare the signal quality against the prediction. 
-->

---

# ✅

<!--
Now this network was fully functional and battle tested.
-->

---

# 💡

<!--
But this developer was given a feature request.
-->

---

# 🔍

<!--
Given they know what state produces a good signal quality.
-->

---

# 💾

<!--
It should be cached, so they don't have to run these expensive calculations. 
-->

---

# 

<!--
Now a cache is not exactly a difficult implementation.
-->

---

# 🤔

<!--
But this developer, having built out, and having a deep understanding of the system, decided to think about it.
-->

---

# 📝

<!--
And they realised that the cache would need:
-->

---

# 📻

<!--
The transmission frequency
-->

---

# 📡

<!--
The transmitter power, antenna type, orientation, and location of the source antenna.
-->

---

# 📡

<!--
The transmitter power, antenna type, orientation, and location of the destination antenna.
-->

---

# 🌍

<!--
(Side note, countries are quite big)
-->

---

# ❓

<!--
But did that matter, if calculating the state of the ionosphere needed:
-->

---

# 🕐

<!--
The time of day,
-->

---

# 📅

<!--
The time of year,
-->

---

# ☀️

<!--
And where you are in the the 11 year solar cycle?
-->

---

# ⏰

<!--
Effectively making the cache only useable once every 11 years
-->

---

# 🤷

<!--
If at all, considering how many things change in a decade.
-->

---

# ❌

<!--
I don't blame whoever had suggested the feature.
-->

---

# 🧠 

<!--
On the surface it was a perfectly reasonable idea
-->

---

# 💡

<!--
And it's in our human nature to want to improve things.
-->

---

# 🎯

<!--
To me, it shows the importance of having a good understanding of the system.
-->

---

# 🧠

<!--
The ability to apply critical thinking, before excitedly rushing to a what would have been an easy implementation that would have no effect.

Similarly, one of my favourite quotes: 

"[Instead of thinking] How can I make this engineering process faster, maybe look at how you can get rid of whatever it is completely"
-->

# 🧪

<!--
Instead of thinking, how can I fix this flakey test, maybe look at what value that test is providing in the first place.

# ♾️

<!--
Removing that test, that process, that would now no longer provide value, is infinity more valuable than perpetually spending time fixing it.

But that's not possible if you don't truly understand the system.

```html
<Toc minDepth="1" maxDepth="1" />
```

The title will be inferred from your slide content, or you can override it with `title` and `level` in your frontmatter.

# Shiki Magic Move

Powered by [shiki-magic-move](https://shiki-magic-move.netlify.app/), Slidev supports animations across multiple code snippets.

Add multiple code blocks and wrap them with <code>````md magic-move</code> (four backticks) to enable the magic move. For example:

````md magic-move {lines: true}
```ts {*|2|*}
// step 1
const author = reactive({
  name: 'John Doe',
  books: [
    'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
    'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
    'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
  ]
})
```

```ts {*|1-2|3-4|3-4,8}
// step 2
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      author: {
        name: 'John Doe',
        books: [
          'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
          'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
          'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```ts
// step 3
export default {
  data: () => ({
    author: {
      name: 'John Doe',
      books: [
        'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
        'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
        'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
      ]
    }
  })
}
```

Non-code blocks are ignored.

```vue
<!-- step 4 -->
<script setup>
const author = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  books: [
    'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
    'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
    'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
  ]
}
</script>
```

You can use Vue components directly inside your slides.

We have provided a few built-in components like `<Tweet/>` and `<Youtube/>` that you can use directly. And adding your custom components is also super easy.

```html
<Counter :count="10" />
```

<!-- ./components/Counter.vue -->
<Counter :count="10" m="t-4" />

# Clicks Animations

You can add `v-click` to elements to add a click animation.

<div v-click>

This shows up when you click the slide:

```html
<div v-click>This shows up when you click the slide.</div>
```

</div>

<br>

<v-click>

The <span v-mark="{ at: 3, color: 'red', seed: 1 }"><code>v-mark</code> directive</span>
also allows you to add
<span v-mark="{ at: 4, color: 'orange', type: 'circle', seed: 1 }">inline marks</span>
, powered by [Rough Notation](https://roughnotation.com/):

```html
<span v-mark.underline.orange>inline markers</span>

# Monaco Editor

Slidev provides built-in Monaco Editor support.

Add `{monaco}` to the code block to turn it into an editor:

```ts {monaco}
import { ref } from 'vue'
import { emptyArray } from './external'

const arr = ref(emptyArray(10))
```

Use `{monaco-run}` to create an editor that can execute the code directly in the slide:

```ts {monaco-run}
import { version } from 'vue'
import { emptyArray, sayHello } from './external'

sayHello()
console.log(`vue ${version}`)
console.log(emptyArray<number>(10).reduce(fib => [...fib, fib.at(-1)! + fib.at(-2)!], [1, 1]))
```
