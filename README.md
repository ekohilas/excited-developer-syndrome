### Abstract

You encountered a problem 🐉. Then, an idea to fix it 💡. Brilliant! ✨
WAIT! 🛑 Come back!
Before you rush off and start implementing...
Let's take a second to look around! 👀
Is **that** the path with the best way to achieve it?

### Description

In an industry where implementation can be so fast or fun, it can be easy to get excited about fixing every problem that comes our way.

And so, we can often forget to pause, look around, and consider:
- Does the solution already exist? Maybe we can contribute to a community solution?
- What is the real end goal? Could our solution be making the problem worse?
- What is the minimum viable product? Maybe we don't need AI...
 
By the end of the session, you'll walk out with a mindset of:
- Finding, using, and contributing towards existing solutions
- Pursuing a deeper understanding of the system
- Focusing on minimising changes

All to help you minimise work, and maximise impact!
